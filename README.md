# Software-Development-Group-Project
This is a library management web application. The goal was to work through the stages of software development and submit the final program at the end of the semester.

I played only a partial role in the development of this web application. Be sure to read through the acknowledgements file to see the contributions of my other group members. The role I played was primaraly in front end development and design.
